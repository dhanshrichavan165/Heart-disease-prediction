In this Dataset there is 38537 rows and 18 coloumns.
Here is 4 numerical and 14 categorical coloumns.
The target coloumn is HeartDesiase.
In this dataset we predict that how many patients are suffering from heartdisease.
The Target coloumn is Binary that's why I used 8 Methods and the methods are Logistic Regression,Decision Tree ,Random Forest,KNN,SVM AdaBoost,xgBoost,Navie Bayes.
The best fitted model for first dataframe is xgBoost.
Here is a huge Class Imbalance so here  I used Over Sampling.
for the second Dataframe xgBoost is best fitted model.
lastly here I used Feature Engineering for the third dataframe again xgBoost is the best fitted model.
For this Dataset xgBoost is the best fitted model.
